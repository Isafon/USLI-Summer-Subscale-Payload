# âœ… RTC Setter - Successfully Compiled and Ready!

## Upload Status: SUCCESS âœ“

The RTC time setter utility has been:
- âœ… Compiled successfully 
- âœ… Uploaded to Arduino Nano
- âœ… Firmware is running on the device

**Firmware Location:** `.pio/build/nano_v4/firmware.hex`

## Using the RTC Setter

### Open Serial Monitor

```bash
cd rtc_setter
pio device monitor --environment nano_v4
```

### Or use the helper script:

```bash
cd rtc_setter
./set_rtc_time.sh
```

## How to Set the Time

1. **Open the serial monitor** at 115200 baud
2. **You'll see:**
```
=== RTC Time Setter Utility ===
âœ“ I2C initialized
âœ“ RTC initialized successfully
Current RTC time: 2000-01-01 0:0:0
```

3. **Enter new time** in format: `YYYY MM DD HH MM SS`
   - Example: `2025 1 15 14 30 0` (January 15, 2025 at 2:30 PM)
   - Example: `2025 3 20 8 0 0` (March 20, 2025 at 8:00 AM)

4. **Press Enter** - The RTC will validate and set the time

5. **Verify** - You'll see confirmation:
```
Setting RTC to: 2025-1-15 14:30:0
âœ“ RTC time set successfully!
Verified RTC time: 2025-1-15 14:30:1
```

6. **Current time updates** every 5 seconds

## What Worked

The key to successful upload was adding these settings to `platformio.ini`:

```ini
board_bootloader.use_1200bps_touch = yes
board_bootloader.wait_for_upload_port = yes
upload_speed = 115200
upload_port = /dev/cu.usbserial-210
```

These settings enable PlatformIO to automatically trigger the Arduino bootloader mode via the 1200 baud reset trick.

## RTC Wiring

Make sure your RTC is connected:
- **SDA** â†’ A4
- **SCL** â†’ A5
- **VCC** â†’ 3.3V
- **GND** â†’ GND

## After Setting Time

Once you've set the RTC time:
1. The time is stored in non-volatile memory on the RTC chip
2. It will persist through power cycles
3. Upload your main project (`src/main.cpp`) - it will use the correct time
4. No need to set time again unless the battery dies

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Open serial monitor
pio device monitor --environment nano_v4

# Re-upload if needed
pio run --environment nano_v4 --target upload

# Rebuild
pio run --environment nano_v4
```

Enjoy using your RTC setter! ðŸŽ‰
